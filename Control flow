User does a move
Board validates and then updates based on that move
View sends websocket packet with the move to server

Server validates the move
Server updates the model
	Server sends websocket packet to all connected clients with the model data
	OR
	Server calls render-component on the react comp. and it auto updates

Views render the data



The view / react never updates the model
The view / react only recieves data, does not send it (exception is ajax and websockets,
														but that's not part of react)
