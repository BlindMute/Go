User does a move
Front end validates the move
Move is added to front end history of boards and board updates
Front sends websocket packet with the move to server

Server validates the move
Server adds the move to the movelist
Server updates the model
Server sends websocket packet with the new movelist

Client receives the movelist and parses that into a new board object
Views render the data



The view / react never updates the model
The view / react only recieves data, does not send it (exception is ajax and websockets,
														but that's not part of react)
